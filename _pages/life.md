Life is not just about academic pursuits and professional achievements—it's about the experiences, passions, and hobbies that shape who we are. Here's a glimpse into the activities and interests that bring joy and balance to my life.

## 🏃‍♂️ Sports

Physical activity has always been an essential part of my routine, helping me maintain both physical health and mental clarity.

**Working out**: I enjoy regular gym workouts, which not only keep me in shape but also provide valuable time for reflection and stress relief. 

**Running**: Running is a great way to get my heart rate up. There's something meditative about the rhythm of running that helps clear my mind.

**Swimming**: Swimming offers a full-body workout while being incredibly peaceful. The sensation of moving through water provides a unique form of both exercise and relaxation.

**Basketball**: Playing basketball combines athleticism with strategy and teamwork. It's a great way for me to stay competitive while building connections with others who share the same passion for the game.

## 🎵 Music

Music has been a constant companion throughout my life, both as a performer and an enthusiastic listener.

**Traditional Chinese Music**: I have played the bamboo flute since I was eight years old.And I also had the honor of joining the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Student Traditional Orchestra. This experience deepened my appreciation for Chinese traditional music and its rich cultural heritage.

**Musical Taste**: My listening preferences span across genres, with a particular love for R&B, soul and music with freedom and creativity. I'm drawn to:

- **Chinese Artists**: David Tao and Leehom Wang, whose innovative approaches to blending Eastern and Western musical elements resonate deeply with me
- **International Icons**: Prince and Michael Jackson, whose groundbreaking artistry and musical genius continue to inspire so many people today

## 📚 Reading

Books have the power to transport us to different worlds and challenge our perspectives. I gravitate toward literature that combines philosophical depth with social commentary.

**Favorite Works**:

- *The Temple of Earth and Me* (我的地坛) - A profound meditation on life, disability, and finding meaning in adversity
- *To Live* (活着) - A powerful exploration of human resilience through China's tumultuous 20th century
- *La Porte Étroite* (窄门) - André Gide's contemplation on love, sacrifice, and spiritual pursuit

These works share a common thread: they explore the human condition with honesty and depth, reflecting the complexities of their respective eras while offering timeless insights. And that is exactly what I love about them and reading.

## 🎮 Gaming

Gaming provides both entertainment and artistic appreciation. I enjoy games that combine engaging gameplay with exceptional design and storytelling.

**Current Favorites**:

- **Hollow Knight**: A masterpiece of indie game design with stunning hand-drawn art and challenging platforming mechanics
- **Forza Horizon 5**: The perfect blend of realistic racing simulation and open-world exploration in beautiful Mexican landscapes  
- **Street Fighter 6**: The latest iteration of this classic fighting game series, offering both competitive depth and accessible gameplay

## 📸 Photography

Through photography, I capture moments that tell stories and preserve memories. Whether it's candid street photography or carefully composed landscapes, I find joy in seeing the world through a different lens and sharing those perspectives with others.

## 🤝 Communication & Connection

I believe in the power of meaningful conversations and genuine human connections. Whether it's discussing ideas with colleagues, sharing experiences with friends, or meeting new people from different backgrounds, I value the exchange of thoughts and perspectives that enrich our understanding of the world and each other.
