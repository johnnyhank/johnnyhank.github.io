Life is not just about academic pursuits and professional achievements—it's about the experiences, passions, and hobbies that shape who we are. Here's a glimpse into the activities and interests that bring joy and balance to my life.

## 🏃‍♂️ Sports & Fitness

Physical activity has always been an essential part of my routine, helping me maintain both physical health and mental clarity.

**Fitness & Running**: I enjoy regular gym workouts and running, which not only keep me in shape but also provide valuable time for reflection and stress relief. There's something meditative about the rhythm of running that helps clear my mind.

**Swimming**: Swimming offers a full-body workout while being incredibly peaceful. The sensation of moving through water provides a unique form of both exercise and relaxation.

**Basketball**: Playing basketball combines athleticism with strategy and teamwork. It's a great way to stay competitive while building connections with others who share the same passion for the game.

## 🎵 Music

Music has been a constant companion throughout my life, both as a performer and an enthusiastic listener.

**Traditional Chinese Music**: I play the bamboo flute (竹笛) and had the honor of joining the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Student Traditional Orchestra. This experience deepened my appreciation for Chinese traditional music and its rich cultural heritage.

**Musical Taste**: My listening preferences span across genres, with a particular love for soul music and artists who embody freedom and creativity. I'm drawn to:

- **Chinese Artists**: Tao Zhe (陶喆) and Leehom Wang (王力宏), whose innovative approaches to blending Eastern and Western musical elements resonate deeply with me
- **International Icons**: Prince and Michael Jackson, whose groundbreaking artistry and musical genius continue to inspire

## 📚 Reading

Books have the power to transport us to different worlds and challenge our perspectives. I gravitate toward literature that combines philosophical depth with social commentary.

**Favorite Works**:

- *My Ditan* (我的地坛) - A profound meditation on life, disability, and finding meaning in adversity
- *To Live* (活着) - A powerful exploration of human resilience through China's tumultuous 20th century
- *Strait is the Gate* (窄门) - André Gide's contemplation on love, sacrifice, and spiritual pursuit

These works share a common thread: they explore the human condition with honesty and depth, reflecting the complexities of their respective eras while offering timeless insights.

## 🎮 Gaming

Gaming provides both entertainment and artistic appreciation. I enjoy games that combine engaging gameplay with exceptional design and storytelling.

**Current Favorites**:

- **Hollow Knight**: A masterpiece of indie game design with stunning hand-drawn art and challenging platforming mechanics
- **Forza Horizon 5**: The perfect blend of realistic racing simulation and open-world exploration in beautiful Mexican landscapes  
- **Street Fighter 6**: The latest iteration of this classic fighting game series, offering both competitive depth and accessible gameplay

## 📸 Photography

Through photography, I capture moments that tell stories and preserve memories. Whether it's candid street photography or carefully composed landscapes, I find joy in seeing the world through a different lens and sharing those perspectives with others.

## 🤝 Communication & Connection

I believe in the power of meaningful conversations and genuine human connections. Whether it's discussing ideas with colleagues, sharing experiences with friends, or meeting new people from different backgrounds, I value the exchange of thoughts and perspectives that enrich our understanding of the world and each other.
