Smart Driver Moniter System Based on IoT
======
July 2024 | Group Project of AIoT of the National University of Singapore School of Computing Summer Workshop 2024

This project ranked **3rd** in 12 Groups.

(1) Group leader: Determined the topic of comprehensive fatigue detection through facial features, posture, heart rate, weather and other data.

(2) Perception layer: Built a perception layer composed of camera, Micro:bit, heart rate sensor, temperature and humidity sensor and light sensor

(3) Network layer: Used Raspberry Pi and ESP32 to initially process the sensor data and send it to the platform layer.

(4) Platform layer: Used MQTT to transmit data, deployed Cloud Server based on EMQX, and cloud database based on Alibaba Cloud, and completed data training.

(5) Application layer: Established a user's front-end website, establish front-end and back-end data transmission through WebSocket, and used MJPG-Streamer to display camera images in real time.
